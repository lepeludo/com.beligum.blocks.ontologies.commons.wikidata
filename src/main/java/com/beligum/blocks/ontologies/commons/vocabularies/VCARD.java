/**
 * The OWL 2 Schema vocabulary (OWL 2)
 *
 * This ontology partially describes the built-in classes and
 * properties that together form the basis of the RDF/XML syntax of OWL 2.
 * The content of this ontology is based on Tables 6.1 and 6.2
 * in Section 6.4 of the OWL 2 RDF-Based Semantics specification,
 * available at http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-rdf-based-semantics/.
 * Please note that those tables do not include the different annotations
 * (labels, comments and rdfs:isDefinedBy links) used in this file.
 * Also note that the descriptions provided in this ontology do not
 * provide a complete and correct formal description of either the syntax
 * or the semantics of the introduced terms (please see the OWL 2
 * recommendations for the complete and normative specifications).
 * Furthermore, the information provided by this ontology may be
 * misleading if not used with care. This ontology SHOULD NOT be imported
 * into OWL ontologies. Importing this file into an OWL 2 DL ontology
 * will cause it to become an OWL 2 Full ontology and may have other,
 * unexpected, consequences.
